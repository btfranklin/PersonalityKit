`PersonalityKit` is a Swift package that contains tools for generating and managing simulated human-like personalities. The design is based on the ["Big Five" model of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), with specific numerical values based on studies done over the years by various parties exploring the practical realities of this model. Where appropriate, references to the research used are provided inside the source code in the form of comments.
